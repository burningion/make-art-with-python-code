# Make Art with Python Code

![Chapter 6 Program](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burningion/make-art-with-python-code/master/images/chapter6.png)

This repository holds all the Python 3 code for my book, [Make Art with Python](https://www.makeartwithpython.com/book/).

You can get a copy from Amazon [here](https://amzn.to/2H4BvhV).

## Requirements

In order to run these programs, you'll need to have Python3 and Pygame installed on your computer. 

It's also easy to run these programs from Python within a terminal or shell. I'll put up a video showing how to install Python and Pygame in Linux, MacOS, and Windows soon.

From there, you simply change into the chapter's directory, and `python3 thefile.py` to run the program.
